    <h2>Managing Stress</h2>
    <p>
      Stress is a natural response to the demands of life, but chronic stress can negatively impact your health and well-being.
      Learning to manage stress effectively can improve your quality of life.
    </p>

    <h3>Understand Your Stressors</h3>
    <p>
      Identify situations, people, or responsibilities that trigger your stress. Self-awareness is the first step toward managing it.
    </p>

    <h3>Practice Relaxation Techniques</h3>
    <p>
      Methods like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, and yoga can help you relax and reduce stress.
    </p>

    <h3>Stay Active</h3>
    <p>
      Physical activity boosts endorphins (feel-good hormones) and improves sleep and mood. Try walking, swimming, or dancing.
    </p>

    <h3>Maintain Healthy Habits</h3>
    <p>
      Sleep well, eat balanced meals, and avoid excessive caffeine or alcohol. These help your body cope with daily stressors better.
    </p>

    <h3>Seek Support</h3>
    <p>
      Donâ€™t be afraid to reach out. Talk to a friend, family member, or a licensed therapist. Support groups also help you connect with others facing similar challenges.
