    <h2>Regulating Sleep for Better Mental Health</h2>

    <p>
      Sleep plays a vital role in our mental, emotional, and physical well-being. When our sleep is out of sync, it can impact
      concentration, mood, and even lead to long-term health issues. Thankfully, there are simple and effective ways to
      regulate your sleep schedule and get more restful nights.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Sleep Matters</h3>
    <p>
      A healthy sleep cycle supports memory, decision-making, emotional balance, and energy levels. Lack of sleep has been linked
      to anxiety, depression, and heightened stress, making it a crucial area to prioritize in mental wellness.
    </p>

    <h3>Tips to Regulate Your Sleep</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stick to a routine:</strong> Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.</li>
      <li><strong>Limit screen time:</strong> Avoid phones, tablets, and computers at least an hour before bed.</li>
      <li><strong>Create a sleep-friendly environment:</strong> Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid caffeine and heavy meals at night:</strong> These can delay sleep or cause discomfort.</li>
      <li><strong>Try a wind-down ritual:</strong> Activities like reading, journaling, or deep breathing can signal your body it’s time to rest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What to Do if You Can't Sleep</h3>
    <p>
      Don’t stress if you can’t fall asleep right away. Get out of bed and do a quiet activity like stretching or reading under soft light,
      then try again. Over time, your body will respond better to cues and settle into a healthier rhythm.
    </p>

    <h3>Sleep and Mental Health Are Connected</h3>
    <p>
      Poor sleep can be both a cause and a symptom of mental health issues. Taking steps to regulate your sleep can help improve
      your overall mood and mental clarity. If sleep problems persist, it's okay to reach out for professional support.
